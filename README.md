# Diabetes-Tracker

We will be creating models, to predict if a person has Diabetes or not. 
And we will also be working on detection of Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) based on patient's daily data.
This will later be integrated with an app which keeps a track of Patient's data, and gives analysis based on the above models.

Datasets have been uploaded.
You can read about the two datasets here.
